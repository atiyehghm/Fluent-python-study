    "#### Concurrency vs. paralellism\n",
    "\n",
    "concurrency is about dealing with so many things at once but not paralell. paralellism means doing them all at the same time. In concurrency we usually give the system the chance to do many things by improving each in a short time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main problem with concurrent programming is that you don't know where exactly the running process goes. When you have a function, you know when it ends and how to get the output but in a Thread, you need something like a message queue to handle the thread execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "coroutines are simpler than threads to start and get a value from; but they are hard to monitor like threads.\n"

    "|        Concurrency               | The ability to handle multiple pending tasks, making progress one at a time or in parallel (if possible) so that each of them eventually succeeds or fails.|\n",

    "| **Process**  | An independent running program with its own memory space. Processes can have child processes and communicate via serialization (pipes, sockets). Uses **preemptive multitasking** managed by OS. |\n",
    "| **Thread**   | An execution unit within a process. Threads share the same memory space, allowing easy data sharing but risking data corruption if not synchronized. Also uses **preemptive multitasking**. |\n",
    "| **Coroutine** | A function that can pause (yield/await) and resume later. Runs cooperatively within an event loop, enabling **asynchronous programming** with minimal resource use compared to threads or processes. |\n",
    "| **Queue**    | A data structure (usually FIFO) for passing items between execution units safely. Different implementations exist for threads (`queue`), multiprocessing, and async (`asyncio`). |\n",
    "| **Lock**     | An object to synchronize access to shared data, preventing data corruption by allowing only one execution unit at a time to modify it. Also called a mutex (mutual exclusion). |\n",
    "| **Contention** | Competition for limited resources, e.g., multiple threads/processes wanting the CPU (CPU contention) or a shared lock (resource contention). Leads to waiting and performance impact. |\n",
